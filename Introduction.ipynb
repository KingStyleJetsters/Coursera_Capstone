    "The purpose of this Project aims to create an analysis and visualization to help provide information to local people who must be alerted to go out of the house from the distribution of the COVID-19 case in India within their specific states and union territories. Also, to better visualize the clustering of our neighborhood, we will be creating a custom function that we call ‘regioncolors’ that will assign a color to each area within a 500-meter radius of our proposed facility firmly signifying their safety. It also aims to provide information on the states or union territories that are most needed for a lot of mask distribution, according to population density and number of increasing cases in that area.\n",

    "Further, this project is also going to provide information to the medical equipments producation companies or businesses on which state or union territory hospitals that need the most medical equipments for COVID-19 treatment, based on the number of patients or cases in their specific state or union territory, possibly even additional medical personnels (doctors and nurses). It also provides information on the business neighborhood which shall implement COVID-19 health protocol with a high discipline when “new normal” comes."

To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm."
